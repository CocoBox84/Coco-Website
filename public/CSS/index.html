Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are considered intellectual property and are protected by copyright law, meaning that the code you write in CSS is automatically copyrighted once created, and unauthorized copying or distribution of that code could be considered copyright infringement; however, the basic functionality and structure of CSS itself is not typically considered copyrightable as it's a standard developed by the W3C. 
Key points about CSS and copyright:
Automatic protection:
When you write CSS code, you automatically gain copyright protection over it. 
Not just the design:
While the visual appearance of a website designed using CSS might be protected by copyright, the underlying CSS code itself is also considered protected. 
Not copyrightable aspects:
The basic structure and functionality of CSS, as defined by the W3C standards, are not considered copyrightable. 
Infringement concerns:
If someone directly copies large portions of your unique CSS code without permission, it could be considered copyright infringement.
